# Regex Data Extraction - ALU Assignment

Good Day Facilitator, this project is going to extract data from text files using Python and Regular Expressions (regex)

## Data Types Extracted

- Email addresses (e.g., user@example.com)
- URLs (e.g., https://www.example.com)
- Phone numbers (formats like (123) 456-7890, 123-456-7890, 123.456.7890)
- Credit card numbers (formats like 1234 5678 9012 3456 or 1234-5678-9012-3456)

## Files

- `data_extractor.py` — This Python script is going to read input from `test_input.txt`, extracts the data, and write the results to `test_output.txt`.
- `test_input.txt` — Sample input text file containing sample data (feel free to add your own text here).
- `test_output.txt` — Output file generated by running the script showing extracted data.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. There are sample inputs inside of the `test_input.txt`.
3. Run the extraction script from the terminal or command line:

```bash
python data_extractor.py
